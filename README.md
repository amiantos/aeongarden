# Aeon Garden

Aeon Garden is a stylish, simple artificial life simulation. Creatures are born, eat, mate, and die in a virtual tank; their attributes can be passed on to their offspring, and mutations occur along the way, so every tank will evolve differently. Aeon Garden is meant to be a passive experience, something you leave on in the background while you're doing other things.

## Why

Like [Numu Tracker](https://www.github.com/numutracker/numutracker_ios), Aeon Garden is both a learning project and a labor of love. I've always loved little artificial life simulations, no matter how rudimentary. Aeon Garden is also helping me learn more things: SpriteKit, GameKit, CoreData with CloudKit, creating views and constraints programmatically, more elaborate view animations, better code organization, and cross-platform development.
