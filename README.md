# Aeon Garden

Aeon Garden is an attempt create a cool little artificial life "fish tank" app for iOS using SpriteKit.

The creatures generated are meant to swim around, hunt for food, and mate. Their attributes can be passed on to offspring, so families will develop who have similar colors, shapes, and abilities.

There is no scientific basis for anything about this app. It's meant to be a simple virtual tank full of little creatures, not a rigorous exploration of natural selection or evolution.

# To Install
