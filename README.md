# Aeon Garden

Aeon Garden is a stylish, simple artificial life simulation. Creatures are born, eat, mate, and die in a virtual tank; their attributes can be passed on to their offspring, and mutations occur along the way, so every tank will evolve differently. Aeon Garden is meant to be a passive experience, something you leave on in the background while you're doing other things.

Aeon Garden is cross platform (on Apple devices), featuring apps for iOS, tvOS, macOS, and a screensaver. Favorite creatures and saved tanks will sync across devices and be available for use in the screensaver.

**Please Note:** This project is actively under construction! If you'd like to contribute, please contact me @[amiantos](http://www.twitter.com/amiantos) on Twitter or some other way.

## Why?

Like [Numu Tracker](https://www.github.com/numutracker/numutracker_ios), Aeon Garden is both a learning project and a labor of love. I've always loved little artificial life simulations, no matter how rudimentary. Aeon Garden is also helping me learn more things: SpriteKit, GameKit, creating views and constraints programmatically, more elaborate view animations, better code organization, and cross-platform development.

## Video & Screenshots

Screenshots of Aeon Garden look a little boring, so be sure to watch this **[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfABigM2Ik)**.

These screenshots are from the tvOS version.
