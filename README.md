# Aeon Garden

Aeon Garden is an attempt create a cool little artificial life "fish tank" app for using SpriteKit that'll run on macOS, iOS, and tvOS.

The creatures generated are meant to swim around, hunt for food, and mate. Their attributes can be passed on to offspring, so families will develop who have similar colors, shapes, and abilities.

There is no scientific basis for anything about this app, and it's not using machine learning. It's meant to be a simple virtual tank full of little creatures, not a rigorous exploration of natural selection or evolution.

# To Install

1. `git clone https://github.com/amiantos/aeongarden.git`

Things are changing really quickly, so [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8q0lP9vdbY&feature=youtu.be) is already out of date. Recently my focus as shifted to the tvOS version of the app, here are some shots of what it looks like now:
